# Fun with Gradients
This repository is composed of Colaboratory notebooks and notes exploring gradient methods and applications

The notebooks are:
*  0-Automatic_Differentiation.ipynb - A short notebook to demonstrate using the autograd capabilities for numerical differentiation of functions
*  1_FunctionMinimization.ipynb - A short notebook to demonstrate using the autogrd capabilities for general function minimization of convex functions
*  2_Gradient_Descent_Neural_Style_Transfer.ipynb - A notebook that demonstrates using a Colaboratory Notebook with Google Drive to leverage Transfer Learning with pre-trained models (I used this to update my photo to a more interesting photo)

Nore notebooks will be added.
